# Templates

In Aurelia, a template is just HTML. However, where Aurelia differs from conventional HTML is the additional syntax and templating features that it provides to allow developers to build powerful UI's in a familiar and natural way.

When you generate an Aurelia application using the CLI, your default view template will be `my-app.html`

## Enhanced HTML

By using Aurelia's templating syntax, you can enhance native HTML in a way that doesn't feel too far from the native HTML path. Because Aurelia abides by web standards, all of the HTML that you write inside of your Aurelia views is valid HTML, from how attributes are named to custom elements and template control features.

As a security precaution, Aurelia will not allow you to use script elements inside of your Aurelia views.  This is to prevent script injection attacks and other forms of unsafe code from making your Aurelia applications insecure.
