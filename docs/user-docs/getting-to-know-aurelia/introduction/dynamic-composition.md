Invariably, there comes a time when you need to render data dynamically in your components without necessarily knowing the type of data you want to display. There is this grey area between custom elements and custom attributes where neither really fits, this is where the `<au-compose>` element helps.

## Composing UI

The `<au-compose>` element allows us to compose view/view model pairs as well as just views, kind of like a custom element without having to specify a tag name.
