Depending on the router mode you are using, the router supports varying types of syntax. You will most commonly use routes to navigate to sections in your application, but also pass in information such as ID or slug values in the URL.

## A basic configured route

When working with configured routes, there are more things you can configure with routes. You can add optional parameters as well as wildcard parameters into your routes.

## Direct routing syntax

While the direct router is built on the concept of zero-configuration and component composition when routing to components using the direct router you can still pass in values to the route and define how the routes look.
