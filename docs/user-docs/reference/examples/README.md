# Playground

A picture is worth a thousand words and a code snippet is worth a thousand hours. If you're looking to learn parts of Aurelia by reference using code examples, you are in the right place.

Each section in the playground has been dedicated to a different component of Aurelia. The basics of templating and plugins are covered. However, for proper documentation on numerous aspects of Aurelia, please consult the relevant sections.

You will only find code examples in the playground, not explanations.
